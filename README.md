# Deposits Validators
## Overview
This repository contains a list of validators to be used with the Vuelidate library for Vue.js. It redefines several 
validators to be consistent with the Deposits internal standards and adds a number of validators that are used across
different projects.

The validators are designed to be used with Vuelidate in Vue.js but can also be used with other libraries that support
custom validators as all the validators consist of pure functions that return a boolean value.

## Installation
To install the validators, simply run the following command in your project directory:
```bash  
npm install @deposits/validators
```
